# Questions
### (1) Do your selected project use Continous Integration? If yes, what is the service that it uses (Travis CI, GitHub Actions, Jenkins, Bamboo)? You can check the service used by clicking on the build:passing/failing badge. (If no, answer this question by checking what is the service that https://github.com/google/guava used?)

No, then I will checking the `https://github.com/google/guava` instead.

The guava use the GitHub Actions as the service tool it does.

### (2)What are the jobs (e.g., install, script) defined to be run with CI for your selected project.(If your project does not use CI, answer this question by checking https://github.com/google/guava used?)

The jobs in guava's CI are something like install the dependencies, publish the snapshot and generate documentations.
